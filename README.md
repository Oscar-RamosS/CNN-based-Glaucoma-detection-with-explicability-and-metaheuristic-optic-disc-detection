# CNN-based-Glaucoma-detection-with-explicability-and-metaheuristic-optic-disc-detection
This repository contains the source code of the metaheuristic-based optic disc detection in eye fundus image and the glaucoma detection using different CNNs (VGG-19, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-161) with explainability using different Class Activation Maps (CAMs) such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation
Mapping (Grad-CAM), Score-CAM, and Eigen-CAM.

# Project status
The project is currently in preparation for release. We are finalizing the codebase and documentation, and the repository will be made public shortly.
